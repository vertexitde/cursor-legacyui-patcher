# Cursor Layout Patcher

Restores the full **Change Layout** menu (Agent, Editor, Zen, Browser, toggles, and related options).  
Patches `workbench.desktop.main.js` and updates checksums in `product.json` (and optionally `nls.messages.json`).

## Quick info

- **Reference (old menu still visible):** `C:\Program Files\cursor-old` (if you have it installed).
- **Typical current install (per-user):** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\cursor`.

**Before patching:** **Quit Cursor completely**, then run `run-patcher.bat` in the matching folder (or run `patcher.ps1` with PowerShell).

## Patchers by Cursor version

Sorted with **newest first**. Folders under `Outdated\` are archived / superseded patch sets; they still work if your installed Cursor version **exactly** matches that row.

## Notes

- **Use the patcher that matches your exact Cursor version** (see `product.json` → `version` or *About*). The wrong patch set may report “Targets not found” or break the workbench bundle.
- **Outdated** only means a newer patch folder exists in this repo; an older folder is still valid if your app is still on that version.
- From **2.7.0-pre.87** onward, stock `buildContent` includes **`appendGlassWindowButton`** (e.g. “Open Glass Window” in newer builds). Current patch sets keep that call at the end of `buildContent`.
